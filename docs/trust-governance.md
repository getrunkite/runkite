# Trust & governance

Runkite is a control plane. Security that fits is **governance of the plane**: who can run which agent, with which tools/secrets, under which budgets, with kill-switches and an audit trail — self-hosted.

This page documents the trust boundary and what is (and is not) enforced today. It deliberately under-promises.

## Trust boundary

```
Clients (SDK / HTTP / Admin UI)
        │  Agent Protocol + client auth
        ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Runkite control plane      │  ← enforcement surface
│  auth · tenants · runs      │
│  connectors · MCP proxy     │
│  store/vector proxy         │
└───────────┬─────────────────┘
            │ Runner Protocol (gRPC) + /internal/* HTTP
            ▼
        Runners (framework code, LLM calls, native tools)
```

**What the plane always sees:** client identity (when auth is configured), run create/cancel/stream, job dispatch/fencing, connector session minting, MCP proxy forwards, proxy-mode store/vector calls.

**What the plane does not see:** raw LLM prompts/completions (unless you add your own proxy), framework-native tool bodies that bypass connectors, direct-mode Postgres/pgvector access from the runner process.

## Run-binding (current)

Proxy paths that touch tenant data or credentials require an **active run**:

| Path | Binding |
|------|---------|
| `POST /internal/connectors/{name}/session` | Required |
| `POST /internal/connectors/{name}/mcp` | Required |
| `/internal/store/*` | Required |
| `/internal/vectors/*` | Required |
| Other `/internal/*` (schema, status, A2A, connector metadata) | Runner token only |

Runners send `X-Runkite-Run-Id` and `X-Runkite-Generation` (the fencing generation from `GetJob`). The control plane looks up the in-flight `RunAssignment` and derives `tenant_id` / agent (`graph_id`) / principal (`user`) from that record. Runner-supplied `X-Runkite-Tenant-Id` is **not** trusted on bound paths.

Stable `reason_code` values on denials include:

| `reason_code` | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|
| `runner_credentials_invalid` | Missing/wrong runner kind token |
| `runner_tenant_denied` | Tenant not on `RUNNER_TENANTS_<KIND>` |
| `run_binding_required` | Missing/invalid run id or generation |
| `run_not_inflight` | No active assignment for that run id |
| `run_generation_mismatch` | Stale/superseded generation |
| `run_binding_lookup_failed` | Queue lookup error |

## Tiers

| Posture | Notes |
|---------|--------|
| Local (`runkite dev`) | Runner auth off; fine for single-user laptops |
| Production baseline | Durable store + shared transport + `RUNNER_TOKEN_*` + client `auth` (admission refuses bare `serve`) |
| Multi-tenant | Client auth + run-binding on proxy paths; set `RUNNER_TENANTS_<KIND>` so unbound `/internal/*` routes cannot claim arbitrary tenants |

## Explicit non-goals (today)

- Prompt-injection / jailbreak classifiers
- PII scanning or output moderation
- Sandboxing arbitrary tool code inside the runner
- Transparent egress MITM for every BYO `httpx`/`fetch` call
- Replacing your IdP
- Equal security proofs on Experimental state/transport backends

Policy deny at the connector proxy, durable audit query, and HITL for `pending` tool calls are on the roadmap; this document will grow as those ship. Until then, treat run-binding + runner tokens + optional tenant allow-lists as the enforceable floor.
